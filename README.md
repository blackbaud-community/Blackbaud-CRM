## Introduction ##

Introducing GitHub as the new home for [Blackbaud CRM SDK and API Code Samples](http://blackbaud-community.github.io/Blackbaud-CRM/) for customers, third party developers and partners.  Over time, Blackbaud will place code additional samples into GitHub. You are free to grab a local copy of one or more of the project repositories (such as the [API Cookbook](https://github.com/blackbaud-community/Blackbaud-CRM-API-Cookbook)) and play with the samples. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is based on [git](http://git-scm.com/) which is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.   GitHub is a great platform for improving existing and adding new samples.

We've created a [detailed getting started guide](../../wiki) for interacting with our code samples.  Should you have any questions regarding the code samples, please do not hesitate to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md), file an issue, or email bobby.earl@blackbaud.com.
