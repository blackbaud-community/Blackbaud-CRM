# How to Contribute

Third-party contributions are how we keep the code samples great. Blackbaud simply can't create every conceivable code sample. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that show others how to do cool things with the Blackbaud CRM SDK and API. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

Below is an outline of the high level steps required to grab the code, begin making changes, and optionally contribute your work back to the community.

* Have a basic understanding of Github.  Additional details of our workflow are provided in the [detailed contributing document](../../wiki/How-to-Contribute).
* Make sure you have a [Github account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork - Fork any of the [blackbaud-community](https://github.com/blackbaud-community) repositories you're interested in contributing to.

## Make Changes

* Clone - Clone your fork to your local computer.
* Although not necessary, we also suggest creating a development branch to work in.
* Hack away!  Begin making local changes to the code, preferably in your development branch.  
* Commit your local changes.

## Submit Changes

* Push - Push your local changes to your fork on GitHub.
* Sign - ***[Sign the CLA before you submit a Pull Request](http://www.bbdevnetwork.com/cla/)***
* Pull Request - Submit a Pull Request

# Requesting a New Repository

If you have new samples you wish to contribute, which don't apply to our current repositories, we invite you to [open an issue](https://github.com/blackbaud-community/issues], providing more information and tagging it with the "code sample request" label.
